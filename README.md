# My First Frontend Challenge

## Description

This is the result of my first frontend challenge! I was challenged by Alura to create a page for new hires. The designer provided a project on Figma, but it only covered the Desktop version, allowing me to make some changes and add interactions.

## Figma Layout

The project layout can be accessed through this link: [Figma Layout](https://www.figma.com/file/mm3MLozvUDGhDRTxSLlGL5/7daysOfCode-HTML-CSS?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS (using the Sass preprocessor)
- Swiper.js API

## Responsiveness

For this project, I've adopted the method "desktop-first", and later developed specific layouts for tablets and mobile devices.

## About the Swiper.js API

The Swiper.js API was a great choice to implement slider and carousel features in the project. It provided an excellent user experience and allowed me to create modern and responsive interactions.

## Notes

- The project was developed without the use of JavaScript, relying solely on HTML and CSS.
- The Sass preprocessor was a valuable tool that assisted me during the development process, making the code more organized and easy to maintain.
